# Ticket-booking-system
This project is the part of Hyperverge assignment.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To Setup a NodeJS server on EC2 to handle ticketing for a bus company.
Context:
1 bus, 40 seats. One ticket per seat.
### Features from the server:
* Update the ticket status (open/close + adding user details)
* View Ticket Status
* View all closed tickets
* View all open tickets
* View Details of the person owning the ticket.
* Additional API for admin to reset the server (opens up all the tickets)

Use an appropriate database to handle the problem. The server needs to expose the features via APIs
based on REST principles and event driven logic to be implemented in every possible situation.
Additionally, write appropriate test cases to simulate practical scenarios that you would want to test the
system for. Maintain the code through the course of the development on a version control system.
